# metatrader4-harm_pets
A tool which helps to draw harmonic patterns on the charts by moving arrows (points 1, 2, and 3) to select a place where you want to draw the first triangle of harmonic pattern. The rest will be done by this indicator. If there are any workable patterns then it will show them.
